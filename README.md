# Adventure US
https://cmpt276-project-1.onrender.com/login
Welcome to AdventureUS, a travel planning app designed to help international students at Simon Fraser University (SFU) explore Burnaby and Vancouver with ease. Whether you're new to the area or just want to discover new places, AdventureUS creates personalized itineraries to match your preferences.
The current methods of travel planning often involve a combination of manual research and reliance on existing travel advisories and platforms such as TripAdvisor. While these resources offer valuable insights into popular attractions and dining options, they may not sufficiently cater to the specific needs and preferences of individual travelers, especially those who are new to the area. International students, in particular, face the challenge of navigating a new city without the benefit of local knowledge or established networks.
Recognizing the existing methods of travel planning as time-consuming and often lacking personalization, requiring users to sift through a plethora of options to create a cohesive plan for their day. The proposed web application seeks to streamline the process of itinerary planning by providing tailored suggestions for activities, dining options, and sightseeing destinations throughout the day. By automating this process, users, particularly international students, will benefit from a curated guide that maximizes their exploration of the Greater Vancouver area. 

# Why We Built AdventureUS
As international students, we understand the challenge of navigating a new city without much local knowledge. While tools like TripAdvisor exist, they don't always provide personalized recommendations for new arrivals. We wanted to solve this by creating a simple, intuitive platform that gives international students tailored suggestions for activities, dining, and sightseeing — all in one place.
